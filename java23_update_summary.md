# Project Update to Java 23 - Summary

## Changes Made

The project has been successfully updated from Java 17 to Java 23. The following files were modified:

1. **pom.xml**
   - Changed `<java.version>17</java.version>` to `<java.version>23</java.version>`
   - This is the primary configuration for the Maven build to use Java 23

2. **IntelliJ IDEA Configuration Files**
   - **.idea/compiler.xml**
     - Updated bytecode target level from 17 to 23: `<module name="fullstack-backend" target="23" />`
     - This ensures that the Java compiler in IntelliJ IDEA uses Java 23 for compilation

   - **.idea/misc.xml**
     - Updated ProjectRootManager to use JDK 23: `<component name="ProjectRootManager" version="2" languageLevel="JDK_23" project-jdk-name="23" project-jdk-type="JavaSDK" />`
     - This configures the project's JDK in IntelliJ IDEA to use Java 23

   - **fullstack-backend.iml**
     - Updated language level from JDK_17 to JDK_23: `<component name="NewModuleRootManager" LANGUAGE_LEVEL="JDK_23">`
     - This ensures that the module uses Java 23 language features

## Benefits of Java 23

Java 23 is the latest version of Java (as of September 2024) and includes several improvements and new features:

1. **Performance Improvements**: Java 23 includes various performance optimizations and improvements
2. **New Language Features**: Latest language enhancements and syntax improvements
3. **Security Updates**: Latest security patches and improvements
4. **Library Updates**: Updated standard libraries with new functionality

## Next Steps

After updating the project to Java 23, you should:

1. **Build the Project**: Run a Maven build to ensure everything compiles correctly with Java 23
2. **Test the Application**: Run tests to ensure that the application works correctly with Java 23
3. **Check for Compatibility Issues**: Some libraries or frameworks might not be fully compatible with Java 23, so check for any issues

## Note

Spring Boot 3.4.1 (which this project uses) is compatible with Java 23, so there should be no compatibility issues with the Spring framework.
