# JDK Version Mismatch Issue Summary

## Problem
The project is experiencing an issue where all annotations and imports are showing as red (indicating errors) in the IntelliJ IDEA editor. After thorough investigation, I've determined that this is caused by a **JDK version mismatch** between what the project requires and what is installed on your system.

## Key Findings

1. **Project Configuration**:
   - The project is configured to use Java 17 in the pom.xml file: `<java.version>17</java.version>`
   - The IntelliJ IDEA configuration files (.idea/misc.xml and .idea/compiler.xml) are also set to use Java 17

2. **System Configuration**:
   - Your system has Java 23.0.2 installed, as shown by the `java -version` command
   - This creates a mismatch between the project's expected Java version and the available Java version

3. **Missing Build Artifacts**:
   - The project has not been built with Maven yet (no target directory)
   - The .idea/libraries directory is missing, which is unusual for a Maven project
   - These missing elements suggest that the Maven dependencies have not been properly resolved

## Solution

I've created a detailed guide with multiple options to resolve this issue:

1. **Install Java 17** and configure IntelliJ IDEA to use it (recommended for maintaining compatibility)
2. **Update the project to use Java 23** instead of Java 17 (simpler but may introduce compatibility issues)
3. **Use the Maven wrapper with Java 17** (a middle-ground approach)

The full instructions are available in the `jdk_fix_instructions.md` file.

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The red highlighting of annotations and imports occurs because IntelliJ IDEA cannot resolve the dependencies properly due to the JDK version mismatch. By aligning the project's Java version with the system's Java version (either by installing Java 17 or updating the project to use Java 23), IntelliJ IDEA will be able to properly resolve the dependencies and eliminate the red highlighting.

Additionally, building the project with Maven will create the necessary build artifacts and library references, further ensuring that all dependencies are properly resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in the `jdk_fix_instructions.md` file to implement the solution
2. Reload the Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are properly resolved
4. Verify that the red highlighting of annotations and imports is gone
