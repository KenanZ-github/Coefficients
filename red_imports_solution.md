# Solution for Red Imports and Annotations in IntelliJ IDEA

## Root Cause

After thorough investigation, I've identified that the red highlighting of imports and annotations in your IntelliJ IDEA project is caused by **two main issues**:

1. **Project Configuration**: The project has been successfully updated to use Java 23 (matching your system's Java version), but this alone is not enough.

2. **Missing Build**: The Maven project has not been built yet, as evidenced by the missing `target` directory. Without a successful build, IntelliJ IDEA cannot properly resolve dependencies, leading to red highlighting of imports and annotations.

## Solution

The solution is to **build the Maven project** to download and resolve all dependencies. I've created a detailed guide in `build_project.md` with step-by-step instructions on how to:

1. Build the project using IntelliJ IDEA's Maven integration
2. Alternatively, build from the command line
3. Invalidate caches and restart IntelliJ IDEA if needed

## Quick Steps

For a quick fix, follow these steps:

1. Open the Maven tool window in IntelliJ IDEA (View → Tool Windows → Maven)
2. Right-click on the project and select "Reload Project"
3. After reload completes, expand the "Lifecycle" folder
4. Double-click on "clean" and wait for it to complete
5. Double-click on "install" and wait for it to complete
6. If imports are still red, go to File → Invalidate Caches / Restart

## Verification

After following these steps, you should see:

1. A `target` directory created in your project
2. All imports and annotations properly recognized (no red highlighting)
3. The ability to run and debug your application

## Previous Changes

In our previous session, we successfully updated the project configuration to use Java 23:

1. Updated `pom.xml` to set `<java.version>23</java.version>`
2. Updated `.idea/compiler.xml` to target Java 23
3. Updated `.idea/misc.xml` to use JDK 23
4. Updated `fullstack-backend.iml` to set language level to JDK 23

These changes were necessary but not sufficient - the project also needs to be built to resolve dependencies.
