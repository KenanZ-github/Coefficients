# Summary of Changes to Fix Red Highlighting on Annotations

## Problem
All annotations in the project were showing as red, along with almost all imports. This indicates that IntelliJ IDEA was not properly recognizing the Maven dependencies in the project. The root cause was a JDK version mismatch - the system has Java 23.0.2 installed, but the project was originally configured to use Java 17.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `pom.xml`
Changed the Java version from 17 to 23 to match the system's installed Java version:
```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>23</java.version>
</properties>
```

### 2. Updated `.idea/compiler.xml`
Updated the bytecodeTargetLevel to target Java 23:
```xml
<bytecodeTargetLevel>
  <module name="fullstack-backend" target="23" />
</bytecodeTargetLevel>
```

### 3. Updated `.idea/misc.xml`
Updated the ProjectRootManager to use JDK 23:
```xml
<component name="ProjectRootManager" version="2" languageLevel="JDK_23" project-jdk-name="23" project-jdk-type="JavaSDK" />
```

### 4. Updated `fullstack-backend.iml`
Updated the NewModuleRootManager to use JDK 23:
```xml
<component name="NewModuleRootManager" LANGUAGE_LEVEL="JDK_23"></component>
```

## Why These Changes Should Fix the Issue
1. The updated pom.xml file now specifies Java 23 as the target version, which matches the system's installed Java version.
2. The updated compiler.xml file now targets Java 23 for bytecode generation.
3. The updated misc.xml file now configures the project to use JDK 23.
4. The updated fullstack-backend.iml file now sets the language level to JDK 23.

These changes align the project's Java version with the system's Java version, which should resolve the issue with red highlighting on annotations and imports.

## Next Steps
Please follow the instructions in the `reload_maven_project.md` file to properly reload the Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA. This will ensure that the changes take effect and that IntelliJ IDEA properly recognizes the Maven dependencies.
